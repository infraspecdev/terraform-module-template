# Security

Infraspec takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all open-source code repositories managed through our organization, [Infraspec](https://github.com/infraspecdev/).

If you find any security vulnerabilities in our open source projects, please report them. We will ensure that your findings are passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Infraspec-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues, discussions, or pull requests in Infraspec repositories.**

Instead, please send an email to <security@infrapsec.dev>.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., improper input handling, token exposure or API abuse in the spell and grammar checking process)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
